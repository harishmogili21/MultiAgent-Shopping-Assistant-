# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current link analysis feature in the shopping assistant is showing incorrect LLM-generated output instead of extracting real product data from e-commerce links. This feature needs to be rebuilt using a multi-agent system with Google Agent SDK to provide accurate product information extraction, analysis, and recommendations from product URLs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to paste a product link and get accurate product information extracted from the actual webpage, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions based on real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes a valid e-commerce product URL THEN the system SHALL extract real product information from the webpage
2. WHEN the system processes a product link THEN it SHALL return accurate product title, price, ratings, availability, and specifications
3. WHEN the extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL display the information in a structured format with clear sections
4. IF the link is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message explaining the issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the link analysis to work with major Indian e-commerce platforms, so that I can analyze products from my preferred shopping sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an Amazon India link THEN the system SHALL extract product data using appropriate scraping methods
2. WHEN a user provides a Flipkart link THEN the system SHALL extract product data using appropriate scraping methods
3. WHEN a user provides links from other major platforms (Myntra, Snapdeal, BigBasket, etc.) THEN the system SHALL attempt extraction with fallback methods
4. WHEN the system encounters an unsupported platform THEN it SHALL inform the user and suggest supported alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered analysis of the extracted product data, so that I can understand the product's value proposition and make better decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product data is extracted THEN the system SHALL provide price analysis comparing with market averages
2. WHEN product data is available THEN the system SHALL analyze product ratings and reviews sentiment
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations on whether to buy, wait, or look for alternatives
4. WHEN multiple similar products are found THEN the system SHALL suggest better alternatives with reasoning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use multiple specialized agents for different aspects of link analysis, so that I get comprehensive and accurate insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a product link THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated web scraping agent for data extraction
2. WHEN analyzing extracted data THEN the system SHALL use a price analysis agent for market comparison
3. WHEN evaluating product quality THEN the system SHALL use a review analysis agent for sentiment analysis
4. WHEN providing final recommendations THEN the system SHALL use a recommendation agent that combines all analyses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the link analysis to handle errors gracefully and provide fallback options, so that I can still get useful information even when direct extraction fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN direct web scraping fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative extraction methods
2. WHEN no product data can be extracted THEN the system SHALL perform a search query based on the URL to find similar products
3. WHEN partial data is extracted THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which information is missing
4. WHEN all extraction methods fail THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions for manual product search

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respect website terms of service and implement proper rate limiting, so that the service remains reliable and ethical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to e-commerce sites THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays between requests
2. WHEN scraping product data THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt files and rate limits
3. WHEN encountering anti-bot measures THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and inform users of delays
